# [673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/)

## Algorithm
#### Binary Search   
The data structure to loop over this problem with binary search is quite complicated in my opinion.   
Ok. The data is 1D and when we throw in a new data in the list, we have the following dimensions to be updated:   
(1) The main "LIS-stack" of the data. Well, it is not quite stack. Every new element throwing in, just to a simple binary search on this "LIS-stack", we can know the LIS of this data.    
This "LIS-stack" has 2 dimensions: (a) the index is the length (in fact length-1) of the LIS (b) the value is the lowest number that can have this length.  
Overall: table\[length of LIS] --> 1D data input. (If many have the same length, choose the smallest number (inherent by binary search))   
The trick to get length instead of length-1 is to start the table with float('inf')


(2) Here is the hidden part: the hash table that maps from the length (well, length -1) to a dictionary ...   
(a) the keys are the elements of the 1D data input (well, when we throw in a new data, we really store it here) 
(b) and the values corresponding to this key is what we want to calculate. It can be the full LIS that up to that points, it can be just counting how many LIS that ends with that key, it can be the sum, ...   
Overall: length of LIS --> 1D data input --> what we want to calculate out of LIS operator   
The trick is to start the hash table with 0 : {-float('inf'): 1} to ease the corner case.

The data structure for this hash table: key : a dictionary with initial value 0 (Counter)   
This might be the point I start to prefer defautdict?
```python
defaultdict(lambda : defaultdict(int)) = defautdict(Counter)? # Should it be this way?- Yes
```

The full code for the problem:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums: return 0
        
        from collections import defaultdict
        # LIS_table: index is length of LIS, value is the smallest number with that length
        LIS_table = [-float('inf')]
        #hash table: length of LIS --> all numbers has that length --> count how many happens
        hash_table = defaultdict(lambda : defaultdict(int))
        hash_table[0][-float('inf')] = 1
        
        for num in nums:
            # insert num to the LIS_table in bisect way
            LIS_length = bisect.bisect_left(LIS_table, num)
            if LIS_length == len(LIS_table): LIS_table.append(num)
            else:                            LIS_table[LIS_length] = num
                
            # update the hash table
            # count the number of LIS with this num by looking at all the LIS_length-1 and append count 
            # count = hash_table[LIS_length-1][val] if val<num
            hash_table[LIS_length][num] += sum([hash_table[LIS_length-1][val] 
                                                for val in hash_table[LIS_length-1] if val<num])
        
        return sum(hash_table[len(LIS_table)-1].values())
```


#### DP
```python

    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums: return 0
        # dp[i] - stats of longest increasing subsequence until i-th element
        dp1 = [1] * len(nums) # len(longestSubsequence), 
        dp2 = [1] * len(nums) # count # longestSubsequence
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            max_ = 1
            count = 0
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    if dp1[j]+1 > max_: 
                        max_ = dp1[j]+1
                        count = 0
                    count += dp2[j] if dp1[j] == max_ - 1 else 0
                    
            dp1[i] = max_
            dp2[i] = max(count, dp2[i])
        return sum(dp2[i] for i in range(len(nums)) if dp1[i] == max(dp1))
```
