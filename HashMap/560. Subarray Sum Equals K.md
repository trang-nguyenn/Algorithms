# [560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

The idea of using a hashmap for this problem is inspired from the classic [Two Sum] problem: we store all current sum to a dictionary and check if pre-Sum exists in the hashmap. Update the HashMap with the current sum (which will eventually be the pre-sum of next calculations)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def subarraySum(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        ref = {0:1}
        ans, curr = 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            curr += num
            ans += ref.get(curr-k, 0)    
            ref[curr] = ref.get(curr,0) +1
        
        return ans
```
