# [1074. Number of Submatrices That Sum to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-submatrices-that-sum-to-target/)

The initial idea to solve this problem is to create a hashmap of pre-Sum to target (similar to [560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/).

However, it is a little bit tricky in this problem to really get the idea of how to loop through the data. The **looping technique** used in this problem is to 
* (1) make the given matrix looks as similar as the 1D array as possible so that we can create a `pre-Sum` variable and 
* (2) Loop through this modified matrix in one dimension by start-end pointers and the other dimension by using the same technique used in the sub-array problem.

## Code:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numSubmatrixSumTarget(self, grid, target):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        nrow, ncol = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        ans = 0
        
        for r in range(nrow):
            for c in range(ncol-1):
                grid[r][c+1] += grid[r][c]
        
        for c_start in range(ncol):
            for c_end in range(c_start, ncol):
                hashMap = {0:1}
                currSum = 0
                for r in range(nrow):
                    currSum += grid[r][c_end] - grid[r][c_start-1] if c_start>0 else grid[r][c_end]
                    ans += hashMap.get(currSum - target, 0)
                    hashMap[currSum] = hashMap.get(currSum, 0) +1
        
        return ans
```
