# [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

This is the first problem that we are introduced to HashMap. In this problem, it requires only two numbers to sum to target; thus, the HashMap will store each of this number with this index and for every iteration, we will check whether a `new number - target` already exists in the HashMap. If yes, we return the index of both numbers.

```
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        ref = {}
        
        for i, val in enumerate(nums):
            if target- val in ref:
                return [ref[target-val], i]
            else:
                ref[val] = i
        return []
```
