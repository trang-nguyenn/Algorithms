We start from the top of the table, and there are various ways to travel to the bottom. I recall the Knight Game or the [Dungeon-Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/). After the intensive Graph algorithm I wrote these days, I thought about using DFS for BFS to search till the depth of the graph.    
       
The key point here is the data is constructed in 2D table, so the DP here is clear, as we did not need to write DFS/BFS to search for the next_moves. We also know the dimensions of the search and no need DFS/BFS to go for "infinite" loops.
   
   Ok, let's see some examples here.
