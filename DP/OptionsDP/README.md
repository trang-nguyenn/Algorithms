There are a few DP problems which concerns finding correct moves to do achieve some optimal result such as [House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/), [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock Series](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/), or [Delete and Earn](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/).

The dp used to solve these problems mostly has 2 dimensions: data dimension (length of houses, stock prices, number list) and problem dimension (how many options one has at a time). Despite having 2 dimensions, many of the times, the DP can be reduced to 1D or even a few variables to represent the different states in the problems.
