Heap and Sorted Structure is very important for the "optimum" looping. When a new input comes in, instead of searching over the entire previous data (O(N)) for this search, we only need O(log(N)) to find the "previous" data that is important for the next search. This can be easily done by `heap` or `bisect` structure.   
   
Important problems include:   
(1) Priority Queue   
(2) Increasing Subsequence     
(3)
