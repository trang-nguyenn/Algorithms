# Problem
[721. Accounts Merge](https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/)

Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

# Algorithm
In this graph problem, the nodes are emails and the edges are (undirected) relationship between the emails (whether they belongs to the same people).

First, create this graph:

```
from collections import defaultdict
visited = [False] * len(accounts)
graph = defaultdict(list)

for i, account in enumerate(accounts):
    for email in account[1:]:
        graph[email].append(i)
```

From this graph, use DFS for each account in the `accounts` list. For each account, look up on the `graph` to see if it is linked to another account.

```
def dfs(i, email):
    # stopping condition
    if visited[i] == True:
        return
    visited[i] = True

    # search with next moves: emails associated with the account [i], dfs with the neighbor in graph
    for j in range(1, len(accounts[i])):
        email = accounts[i][j]
        emails.add(email)
        for neighbor in graph[email]:
            dfs(neighbor, emails)

res = []
for i, account in enumerate(accounts):
    if visited[i]: continue
    name, emails = accounts[0], set()
    dfs(i, emails)
    res.append([name] + sorted(emails))

```

        # print(graph)        
        
        def dfs(i, email):
            # stopping condition
            if visited[i] == True:
                return
            visited[i] = True
            
            # search with next moves: emails associated with the account [i], dfs with the neighbor in graph
            for j in range(1, len(accounts[i])):
                email = accounts[i][j]
                emails.add(email)
                for neighbor in graph[email]:
                    dfs(neighbor, emails)
        
        res = []
        for i, account in enumerate(accounts):
            if visited[i]: continue
            name, emails = accounts[0], set()
            dfs(i, emails)
            res.append([name] + sorted(emails))
        return res
