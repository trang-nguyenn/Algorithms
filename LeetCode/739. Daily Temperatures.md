# Problems
[739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

# Algorithm
This problem is solved by using stack to store the elements waiting for evaluation.

### Stack Solution 
This solution is elegant and its looping technique offers an effective way to solve problems concerning DP forward.

The code structure goes as follows:-

```
ans = [None] * len(arr)
stack = []

for i, val in enumerate(arr):
    while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < val:
        curr = stack.pop()
        (.....)
    stack.append(i) 
```

The `stack` here stores the index of the elements in the array that are pending for evaluation. Each time the last element in the stack satisfies the condition (arr[stack[-1]] < t) stack pop that element out for evaluation.

For the following array, the process is as follows:

`T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]`

```
i, val, [stack], [ans] (ans = i - curr) 
(0, 73, [0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
(1, 74, [1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
(2, 75, [2], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
(3, 71, [2, 3], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
(4, 69, [2, 3, 4], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
(5, 72, [2, 5], [1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0])
(6, 76, [6], [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0])
(7, 73, [6, 7], [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0])
```

# Discussions
The looping technique is elegant and effective. It can be used to solved similar problems for which an element might not be evaluated immediately but until a falling/rising edge is found.

                ans[curr] = i - curr
