# Problems
[547. Friend Circles](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/)

# Algorithm
This is a graph problem. We are able to find the number of groups by doing a dfs for each unvisited elements

The dfs on a starting point is inspired from this code:
```
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    for next in graph[start] - visited:
        dfs(graph, next, visited)
    return visited
```

# Dicussion
The dfs search used in this problem can be used in many other graph problems.

```
class Solution(object):
    def findCircleNum(self, A):
        """
        :type M: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        N = len(A)
        graph = {i: set() for i in range(N)}
        
        graph = {node: set() for node in range(N)}
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i+1, N):
                if i != j and A[i][j]:
                    graph[i].add(j)
                    graph[j].add(i)
        
        visited = set()
        def dfs(start):
            visited.add(start)
            for nxt in graph[start] - visited:
                dfs(nxt)
        
        ans = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if i not in visited:
                dfs(i)
                ans += 1
        return ans
```
