# Problem
[407. Trapping Rain Water II](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water-ii/)
This is the sequential problem of [Trapping Rain Water I](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/); however, this problem is solved by a different technique.

Trapping Rain Water I is the solved by using either pointers or stack, however, Trapping Rain Water II is solved by priority queue. 

# Algorithm
The algorithm is explained in [this Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJayBq38VYw)

The step-by-step process is as follows:-
* Initialize a priority queue and a set of visited elements in the outermost border of the grid, ans = 0.
* We will update this heap queue and visited elements using following rules:
- Pop the index with smallest value `val` in the heap for evaluation. 
- If `val` > `max`, Update `max` = `val`
- For the unvisited neighbor of this popped cell, push (append) to the heap queue. If its `grid[next_r][next_c]` < `max`, push the `max` value in the heap (and increment the `ans` by `max`), else  `grid[next_r][next_c]`.
- Continue to visit all the cells until there is no other cells to visit. Return the final answer.

```
        moves =[(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]
        
        while len(visited) < nrow*ncol:
            Max, r, c = heapq.heappop(queue)
            for dr, dc in moves:
                next_r, next_c = r+dr, c+dc
                if 0<next_r<nrow-1 and 0<next_c<ncol-1 and (next_r, next_c) not in visited: 
                    visited.add((next_r, next_c))
                    (....updating rules.....)

(to be updated). 
The solution to problem is one of the representing example of priority queue(*). This technique is useful for ____

(*) Priority Queue: A priority queue is a container data structure that manages a set of records with totally-ordered keys (for example, a numeric weight value) to provide quick access to the record with the smallest or largest key in the set

# Code

```

        if not grid: return 0
        nrow, ncol = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        # initialize a queue with elements in the border of the grid
        queue = [(grid[r][c], r, c) for r in range(nrow) for c in range(ncol)

                    val = grid[next_r][next_c]
                    if Max >= val:
                        heapq.heappush(queue, (Max, next_r, next_c))
                        ans += Max - val
