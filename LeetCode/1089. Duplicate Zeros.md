# Problem
[1089. Duplicate Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/)

Given a fixed length array arr of integers, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.

Do the above modifications to the input array in place, do not return anything from your function.

**Example 1**
Input: [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: null
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]

**Example 2**
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: null
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]

# Algorithm
- Create a copy of and inserting an extra zero into the original array

```
def duplicateZeros(self, A):
    B = []
    for a in A:
        if a: B.append(a)
        else: 
            B.append(0)
            B.append(0)

    A[:] = B[:len(A)]
```

# Discussion
I often get confused at in-place modification problems. The algorithm used in this problem offers a intuitive, easy-to-remember way to solve this problem by creating a copy of the original array.


# Code
```
def duplicateZeros(A):
        A[:] = [x for a in A for x in ([a] if a else [0,0])][:len(A)]
```
