It is always interesting to loop over the data structure and find a `distinct` set with certain properties.    
I am amazed by the smartness of all the people around that find the `right coordinates` for the looping structure such that when we `throw` the input data to this structure, the `right coordinates` makes sure that we will not count the same set twice.    
In other word, the `right coordinates` makes sure that we label the input data so well that we can not use the 2 labels for one data.   
   
So let's see this collections.
