# [54. Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)

The key to solve this problem is to find the correct looping technique to loop through the data. From the starting position (0,0), the direction to move is sequentially from `left, down, right, up`.

```
moves = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]
```

The strategy to move is to move in its previous direction until the move is no longer valid. Once the move is no longer valid, change the direction from its previous direction to its next direction in `moves`. 

There are 2 conditions for the next move to be valid:
* next move (x+dx, y+dy) is inside the grid: `0 <= x+dx <= nrow` and `0 <= y+dy <= ncol` 
* the next move is to a cell which is not already visited

```python
def isValid(x,y, pointer):
    dx, dy = moves[pointer]
    return 0<= x+dx <nrow and 0<= y+dy<ncol and grid[x+dx][y+dy] != '#'
```

Now, with the correct looping strategy, the problem is solved by the standard dfs.

```python
self.count = 0
def dfs(x,y, pointer):
    ans.append(grid[x][y])
    grid[x][y] = '#' ## mark visited
    self.count += 1

    if self.count != nrow*ncol:
        while not isValid(x, y, pointer):
            pointer = (pointer+1)%4
        dx, dy = moves[pointer]
        dfs(x+dx, y+dy, pointer)

```

# Code
```python
if not grid: return []
    nrow, ncol = len(grid), len(grid[0])

    moves = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]

    def isValid(x,y, pointer):
        dx, dy = moves[pointer]
        return 0<= x+dx <nrow and 0<= y+dy<ncol and grid[x+dx][y+dy] != '#'

    self.count = 0
    def dfs(x,y, pointer):
        ans.append(grid[x][y])
        grid[x][y] = '#'
        self.count += 1

        if self.count != nrow*ncol:
            while not isValid(x, y, pointer):
                pointer = (pointer+1)%4
            dx, dy = moves[pointer]
            dfs(x+dx, y+dy, pointer)

    ans = []
    dfs(0,0,0)
    return ans

```
