This folder includes string-related problems and demonstrations of the common techniques to solve such problems.

Some of the frequently used string manipulation technique:

```python
# Replace: 
s = 'he ll o'
s.replace(' ', '') # strip whitespace

# Join
A = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
''.join(A)

# Reverse string
s = s[::-1]

```
