# Algorithms

This repository contains solutions and discussions related to some of the interesting problems we have solved on LeetCode. 

The problems are divided by categories of methods. We hope to use this materials for passing knowledge and sharing our coding journey.

## List of good problems for frequent reviews:
- Trie(): [Word Search II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)
- UnionFind(): [Smallest String with Swaps](https://github.com/trang-nguyenn/Algorithms/blob/master/UnionFind/1202-smallest-string-with-swaps.md)    
- Topological Sort:  [Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/), [Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/)     
- Binary Search for Sorted Structures   
- Stack of indexes to loop over the data: [Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/), [Longest Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/articles/longest-valid-parentheses/)
